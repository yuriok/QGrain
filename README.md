# QGrain

QGrain aims to provide an easy-to-use and comprehensive analysis platform for grain-size distributionsã€‚ QGrain has implemented many functions, however, there still are many useful tools that have not been contained. Hence, we published QGrain as an open-source project, and welcome other researchers to contribute their ideas and codes. Codes are available at this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/yuriok/QGrain/). More information and tutorials are available at the [offical website](https://qgrain.net/).
