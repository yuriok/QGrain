# QGrain

QGrain aims to provide an easy-to-use and comprehensive analysis platform for grain size distributions. QGrain has implemented many functions, however, there still are many useful tools that have not been contained. Hence, we published QGrain as an open-source project, and welcome other researchers to contribute their ideas and codes. Codes are available at this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/yuriok/QGrain/). More information and tutorials are available at the [offical website](https://qgrain.net/).
